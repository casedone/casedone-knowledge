Lately, I've been reflecting on what truly distinguishes winning AI products. It's becoming clear that a brilliant initial algorithm is just the starting line; the real race is about dynamic, continuous evolution.

I recently explored a concept that deeply resonated with me: the idea of an "AI Emergence Rate." **A big thank you to the author at emcap.com for these insightful thoughts!** At its core, this framework highlights how AI software continuously learns from user interactions and evolves by incorporating proprietary business data, leading to ever-improving outcomes. The premise is powerful: AI with a high "emergence rate" doesn't just adapt—it grows increasingly valuable over time, effectively separating market leaders from those that stagnate.

Key aspects often considered when thinking about this "emergence" include:

* **Velocity of Change:** How quickly the AI adapts and improves.

* **Quality of Change:** The effectiveness and positive impact of these adaptations.

* **Breadth of Adoption:** The widespread use and benefit derived from the AI's continuous learning.

This framework immediately got me thinking: **For any team building AI, prioritizing this continuous learning isn't just an advantage—it's absolutely foundational.** It shifts our focus from building static tools to cultivating living, breathing systems.

So, how can we actually measure this "emergence" in our own products? The original insights suggest asking ourselves critical questions across these key areas:

* **Is our AI improving frequently?** (e.g., how often do models retrain, or new, data-driven features roll out?)

* **Are these improvements truly impactful?** (e.g., how are we quantifying the direct benefits to users—time saved, accuracy gained, revenue generated?)

* **Are users actually adopting these evolving features?** (e.g., what's the growth in engagement with the AI's expanding capabilities?)

* **How robust is our feedback loop?** (e.g., how effectively do explicit user input and implicit behavioral data inform the next AI evolution?)

* **Are we maximizing our unique data advantage?** (e.g., what volume and variety of proprietary data are we integrating, and how is it fueling distinct competitive edges?)

And when we talk about AI software learning about users *granularly* and *quickly*, I believe techniques like **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** are game-changers. They enable our models to:

* **Rapidly incorporate new, specific information** (RAG) without full retraining, allowing for highly relevant responses tailored to individual user contexts or proprietary data.

* **Efficiently adapt to new tasks or user patterns** (PEFT) with minimal data and computational cost, ensuring the AI can quickly specialize and improve without breaking its core capabilities.

In my view, designing for this kind of "emergence" from day one ensures we're not just launching a product, but cultivating a solution that truly adapts and stays indispensable. It's how we build deeper product-market fit, foster genuine user loyalty, and ultimately, ensure our AI products are not just smart, but truly *smarter* over time.
